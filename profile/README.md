# BondForge
Forging Innovation in Bail Bonds

## What is BondForge?  
Many bail bond companies still rely on pen and paper or outdated, subpar software 
solutions. BondForge addresses this issue by utilizing cutting-edge technology, 
enabling bond agents to efficiently write bonds from any device, including their 
phones.  

## The Origin of BondForge  
BondForge represents years of planning and development to enhance the previous 
iteration of the product. In 2010, Uncle Joey Bail Bond Management entered the 
market, offering bonding companies a new way to track and manage bonds. However, 
it came with certain limitations. BondForge has moved beyond those constraints, 
paving a new path for innovation in bail bond software.  

## Release Timeline  
While an official release date has not been announced, we plan to commence alpha 
testing with select clients in 2025. Social media channels will launch in Q2 2025.
