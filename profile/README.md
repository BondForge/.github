# BondForge
Forging Innovation in Bail Bonds

## What is BondForge?
For many the bail bond companies, they are still using pen and paper or are 
using antiquated, or even inferior, software. We aim to solve that. BondForge
is written with cutting edge technology that can allow bond agents to write 
bonds with ease, even from their phone.

## Where did BondForge come from?
BondForge is the result of many years of planning and work to improve the 
previous incarnation of the product. In 2010, Uncle Joey Bail Bond Management
arrived on the scene. It gave bonding companies a new way to track and manage 
their bonds, however it was not without limitations. BondForge has left those
limitations behind and is forging a new path in bail bond software.


## When will BondForge be released?
A release date has not been set yet. We will begin rolling out alpha testing to
clients in 2025.  Social media links will be available in Q1 2025, until then 
stay tuned here for more updates.
